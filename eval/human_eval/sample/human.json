          "When did people first start making cheese?",
          "The production of cheese predates recorded history, beginning well over 7,000 years ago. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated, possibly Europe, or Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Sahara.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that soft raw-milk cheeses can cause \"serious infectious diseases including listeriosis, brucellosis, salmonellosis and tuberculosis\". It is U.S. law since 1944 that all raw-milk cheeses (including imports since 1951) must be aged at least 60\u00a0days. Australia has a wide ban on raw-milk cheeses as well, though in recent years exceptions have been made for Swiss Gruy\u00e8re, Emmental and Sbrinz, and for French Roquefort. There is a trend for cheeses to be pasteurized even when not required by law.",
