          "Can cheese be made from soy milk?",
          "Yes,  the main ingredients are nuts, soy milk, and soy yogurt. Common plant-based proteins or vegetable proteins used in vegan cheeses are derived from edible sources of protein, such as soybeans.",
          "When did people first start making cheese?",
          "The production of cheese predates recorded history, beginning well over 7,000 years ago. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated, possibly Europe, or Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Sahara.",

There is no high-quality clinical evidence that cheese consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",
